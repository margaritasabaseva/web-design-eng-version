							<p>The path that once led me to the University of Latvia every day, but less often in the past year, 
								starts on street named “Džohara Dudajeva gatve”. The street is made up of 16 houses, they are arranged 
								in a zig-zag form in front of an equivalent zig-zag which is formed by near-by Andromedas gatve. 
								The street is located on the north-east side of the Vidzeme suburb of Riga, Purvciems, between Gunāra Astras, 
								Dzelzavas and Lielvārdes streets, which together form a triangular shape on the map, where the starting point 
								of my road can be found. However, I think the story behind the name of the street is the most exciting part of it.
							</p>
							<p> In the 1990s, the former Soviet-era Kosmonautikas Street was renamed in an honor of General and First President 
								of Chechnya – Dzhokhar Dudayev. With this move, Latvia emphasized its support for the fight of Chechen independence 
								and the values promoted by the freedom fighter Dudayev. Dudayev was supported in Latvia because he was the first Soviet general 
								to openly support the restoration of the independence of the Baltic states. In Latvia, as well as in Estonia, Lithuania 
								and elsewhere in Europe, a street, park or other place is honored in the name of Dudayev.
